# Introduction
Code written during the course 'SQL for Data Analysis: Beginner MySQL Business Intelligence' by Maven Analytics

# Mid-Course-Project Case Study
The Maven Movies' company insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance providing company’s underwriters need some updated information from it before they will issue a new insurance policy.

# Mid-Course-Project Objective
Leveraging SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database for the purpose of answering the insurance underwriters’ questions. Each question can be answered by querying just one table. Part of the analysis task is figuring out which table to be used.

# Final-Course-Project Case Study
A Data Analyst and their business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing "Maven Movies". The prospective investor primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for the analyst about their business and the "rental business" in general. His offer seems very generous, so they are going to entertain and listen to his questions.

# Final-Course-Project Objective
To leverage SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database for the purpose of answering the potential investor’s questions. Each question will require writing a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.
